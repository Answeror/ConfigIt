ConfigIt
========

.. image:: TODO

ConfigIt is MIT Licensed Python Configuration library brought to you
by the camera shy people at `Pictage <http://www.pictage.com>`_.

Python is all about the dicts so why do we settle for `INIs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_?


Features
--------

Read configurations from a module, file, or a dictionary
and return a dictionary with attribute access.

One of the most powerful things about configit is its ability to use other
configurations.

    $ pip install configit
